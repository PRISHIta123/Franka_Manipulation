# Franka_Manipulation
Manipulate a Franka Emika Robot Arm in Simulation using various algorithms  


### Classical Control  

- [x] Sinusoidal y-axis joint 4 motion  
- [x] Pick and place joints 0 and 4 motion  
- [x] Proportional-Derivative (PD) control  
  - Follow reference joint trajectories  
- [ ] Inverse Kinematics (IK) / Operational Space Control    
  - Cartesian control of the end-effector  
- [ ] Impedance Control    
  - Simulate compliant behaviors (e.g., pushing, insertion)
